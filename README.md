# Recursive-Algorithm
## HACTOBERFEST

Make your first pull request.

### Task:
-Write any algorithm of your choice in recursive form in any language.

A recursive method is a method that is defined in terms of itself. The general idea behind recursion is that a problem lends itself to a recursive solution if the problem can be broken down into a smaller version of the same problem. A non-CS example of this is the Matroyshka doll. A mathematical example of this is the computation of the factorial of a number. factorial(N) is N*factorial(N-1).

- Create your file in a folder and set the folder name to the algorithm's name.
- Add your files (```git add -A```), commit (```git commit -m "algorithm_name in language_name"```) and push (```git push origin new-user```)
- Create a pull request
- Star this repository
- Wait for Pull Request to merge
